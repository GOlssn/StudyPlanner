## A few words from the developer
During previous projects I've noticed that one of my biggest issues is that I get discouraged when starting to build the front end. This time, to avoid that discouragement I've decided to devote my initial focus to designing the application before starting to build to backend of it. In addition to this I also decided to set a carrot dangling from the stick in front of me and that is React.js. I've grown fond of Javascript as of late and this felt like a good opportunity to learn more about it.
